A city with a myriad of listings has to be a city in the top ten places to visit and among them there are no best candidates than Paris in France. The tourist capital of the world, with a breaking record 40 million tourists per year, Paris is prepared to welcome them. \n",

    "# Initial Research Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting the Occupancy rate:\n",
    "\n",
    "Airbnb guests may leave a review after their stay, and these can be used as an indicator of airbnb activity (although not all guests leave a review, so the actual booking activity would be much higher). The occupancy rate according to Airbnb would be: \n",
    "\n",
    ">***Occupancy_rate = MAX(average_length_of_stay, minimum_nights)x(number_of_reviews)***\n",
    "\n",
    "An average length of stay is configured for each city, and this, multiplied by the estimated bookings for each listing over a period gives the occupancy rate. For Paris, the average_length_of_stay is set to 3 nights/booking \n",
    "\n",
    "**Things to consider:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The listing's ancienty. A listing that just started in Airbnb is less likely to have as much reviews as an older listing. There's at least 7000 listings whose first review dates from this year! \n",
    "\n",
    "*To counteract the ancienty vs new listings bias, I will normalize the occupancy rate per month and assign its average rate as such. The dataset provides a column called reviews per month.*\n",
    "\n",
    "- The availability.  A listing with a high availability is susceptible to get more reviews and thus increasing its occupancy rate. An Airbnb host can setup a calendar for their listing so that it is only available for a few days or weeks a year. Other listings are available all year round (except for when it is already booked). This poses a problem as the availability cannot be considered an accurate measure since it can either show the number of days the listing is supposed to be available but it can also show the remaining days a listing hasn't yet been booked thus lowering its availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "***SCENARIO 1: ***The availability column means the number of days the listing is available per year, set by the host.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the availability column is considered, then those listings with 0 days available will have to be removed or their value set to a non-zero one. There are 13045 listings that have no availability available, aside from that, the average availability is 145 days. \n",
    "\n",
    "Airbnb divides these listings in two categories: High availability for those listings with more than 120 days available and low availability for the rest. In this analysis I will not categorize the listings in these two broad groups but simply assign a weight proportional to its own availability. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then the occupancy rate has to be capped by:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *** Average occupancy_rate per year <= min(1, (min_nights x booking_per_year)/days_available)***\n",
    "\n",
    ".. since the term *(min_nights x booking_per_year)/days_available* can be higher than 1 and therefore not fair for listings with low availability. \n",
